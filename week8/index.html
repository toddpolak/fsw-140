            <ol>
                <li>After you reflect on this course, which topic, activity, or assignment was the most challenging? What did you learn by creating or doing this activity?</li>
                <li>What insights have you gained as a result of this course?</li>
                <li>Having now learned about both relational and non-relational databases, reflect on your experiences with both. Talk about the following:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Difference between the two.</li>
                    <li>Common and famous examples.</li>
                    <li>The reasoning for choosing one over the other.</li>
                    <li>The benefits and drawbacks of each.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

            </div>
            <div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The New Avengers assignment was the most challenging and from this assignment I learned quite a bit including my way around the mySQL environment/user interface. This introduced me to User Defined Functions and Stored Procedures with mySQL. </li>
                    <li>As a result of this course I have gained many insights into the use of SQL. Temporary tables, sub-queries, Joins, associations, aggregate functions. The use of the 'UNION' operator. The difference between SQL and NO-SQL databases. Overall database design.</li>
                    
                        <ul>
                            <li>Relational databases rely on relational tables/schemas and relations for queries. <br />Non-Relational databases do not require relationships between tables, or a fixed schema.<br />Utilizes JSON documents where relationships can be made.</li>
                            <li>Relational databases are far more flexible (though harder to design and maintain) than non-relational databases.</li>
                            <li>Drawbacks of a relational database is that they can sometimes become complex as the amount of data grows, and the relations between pieces of data become more complicated.</li>
                            <li>NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID).<br />In order to support ACID developers will have to implement their own code, making their systems more complex.</li>
